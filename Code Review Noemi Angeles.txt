The author has a very nice simple design for their program and I like that. The clear function resets all data properly without reloading the form and that is nice. Something I experienced is the state selection on the left I was unsure what it was for. When I went to search state or any sort of feature it would sort them properly but would only populate the population column with data the rest would be empty. The button naming convention is nice and easy to follow.
